            So the wolf colored his paw white, went for a third time to the door, knocked at it, and said, "Open the door for me, children. Your dear little mother is here."
         </p>
         <p>
            The little kids cried out, "First show us your paw."
            So he put his paw inside the window, and when they saw it, they believed that everything he said was true, and they opened the door.
