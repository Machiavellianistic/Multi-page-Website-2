            It was not long before someone knocked at the door and called out, "Open the door, children dear, your mother is here."
         </p>
         <p>
            But the little kids knew from the rough voice that it was the wolf.
            "We will not open the door," they cried out. "You are not our mother. She has a soft and gentle voice, but your voice is rough. You are the wolf."
