            The wolf found them all but the youngest and ate them, after satisfying his appetite he layed down under a tree in the green meadow and fell asleep.

            When the old goat came back she found the wolf and cut his stomach open, replacing the eaten kids with stone. He woke up ,thirsty, attempted to drink from a well and drowned.
